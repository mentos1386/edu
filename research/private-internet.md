#### [DHT - Distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)
A distributed hash table (DHT) is a distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.

#### [IPFS - InterPlanetary File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)
Ihe InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

#### [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
